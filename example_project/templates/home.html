  <h1> Welcome to ProjectNarwhal <small>the open source torrent tracker.</small> </h1>
  
  <p> This is the home page and lives at <code>example_project/templates/home.html</code>
      All templates provided by project narwhal can be overridded by placing suitably named
      templates into your project's templates directory. Feel Free to overide the base theme
      With your own by replacing screen.css in <code>example_project/static/</code></p>
  
  <p> ProjectNarwhal has been designed to be fully modular. most modules are enabled by
      default, but you can change these settings in <code>example_project/settings/base.py</code>.
      place any host-specific settings in <code>settings/[hostname].py</code>.
      And don't forget to change <code>SITE_NAME</code> to the name of your site.</p>
